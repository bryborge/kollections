<p>
  Welcome to Kollections, conceived by a <a href="https://github.com/bryborge" target="_blank">software engineer</a>
  with a collector's heart (and a growing inventory of LPs and comic books).
</p>

<p>
  Please know that <strong>this application may be taken offline at any time</strong> and primarily serves the purpose
  of satisfying the author's personal and professional interest in building, deploying, securing, and maintaining a
  piece of software. The actual thing that it does (organizes and manages collections) is secondary and I make no
  claims or guarantees that the app will always function the way it is expected. So in other words, this isn't a
  real product. Use at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
  If this project interests you in any way, please don't hesitate to reach out, say "Hi üëã," or open an
  <a href="https://github.com/bryborge/kollections/issues" target="_blank">issue on GitHub</a>. Also, feel free to use
  any or all (or none) of this code for your own learning and discovery!
